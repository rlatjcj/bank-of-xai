# bank-of-xai

- This repository includes researches about explainable AI, XAI. Each model is organized by [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), and [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) (not yet but I want). 
- Lists of these researches were composed by referring to [Paper-code-review](https://github.com/rlatjcj/Paper-code-review).
- Welcome your contribution!

<br>

## Library
- **TensorFlow** : `tf.keras` is mainly used.
- **PyTorch** : `pytorch_lightning` is mainly used.
- **JAX** : soon
